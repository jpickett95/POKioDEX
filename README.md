# POKioDEX
*Learn about pokemon, moves, in-game object details, abilities, and more all from your iPhone!*

## Project Description
 POKioDEX is a mobile iOS Pokedex application built in Swift, where users can view detailed information on the first 151 Pokemon from the franchise. Users are able to filter and search for entries, and view more detailed 
 information on their selection such as: attributes, abilities, characteristics, locations found in the wild, potential learned moves & their method, etc. The application features 8 different functions users can interact with: 
 the Pokedex, Movesdex, TMsdex, Abilitiesdex, Itemsdex, Locationsdex, Pokemon Naturesdex, as well as a Pokemon type-matchup simulator. Each section of the app will provide users with a searchable/filterable list of entries,
 which when clicked will direct the user to more detailed pages. 
 
 The application was developed in Swift and implementing a MVVM architecture, with the back-end integrating PokeAPI.co (REST API) to retrieve static JSON data. 
 [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) is an awesome community-made RESTful API which is linked to an extensive database of data scrubbed from reputable sources.
